- [2025-06-08 3:05:48 AM] [Unknown User] - Critical Bug Fix - Distance Attenuation: 🎯 **CRITICAL BUG IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**

**Root Cause Analysis**: Two severe mathematical bugs causing far walls to appear bright

## 🔥 **Bug #1: clamp() Function Error**
**Evidence**:
```
🔄 페이드 적용: fadeRatio=5.00001, 최종감쇠=9.77104
🔍 디버깅: directional=0.999979, attenuation=1, 거리=12
```

**Problem**: `std::clamp(9.77104, 0.0f, 1.0f)` → `1.0f`
- Calculated attenuation: 9.77104 (should cause darkness)
- After clamp: 1.0 (maximum brightness!)
- **Result**: Far walls appeared fully lit instead of dark

**Fix**: Replaced clamp with manual check that forces 0.01 when > 1.0

## ⚡ **Bug #2: Negative fadeRatio Mathematical Error**
**Evidence**: `fadeRatio=5.00001` → `pow(1.0f - 5.00001, 4.0f)` = `pow(-4.00001, 4.0f)`

**Problem**: 
- Distance 12 > fadeStart 4.5 → fadeRatio = (12-4.5)/1.5 = 5.0
- `pow(-4.0, 4)` = +256 (even power makes negative positive!)
- Attenuation multiplied by 256 instead of reduced

**Fix**: Added fadeRatio >= 1.0 check for immediate darkness

## 🔧 **Applied Solutions**:

1. **Manual Range Limiting**:
```cpp
if (attenuation > 1.0f) {
    attenuation = 0.01f;  // Force darkness
}
```

2. **Fade Logic Protection**:
```cpp
if (fadeRatio >= 1.0f) {
    attenuation *= 0.01f;  // Complete darkness
} else {
    attenuation *= pow(1.0f - fadeRatio, 4.0f);  // Normal fade
}
```

## 🎯 **Expected Results**:
- **Distance 12**: attenuation = 0.01 (99% dark) instead of 1.0 (bright)
- **Far Walls**: Completely invisible outside flashlight range
- **Authentic Cave**: Only flashlight beam provides visibility
- **Console Warning**: "⚠️ 비정상 감쇠값 감지" when bugs would have occurred

**Impact**: This fixes the fundamental issue preventing authentic cave darkness, finally achieving true flashlight-only visibility.
- [2025-06-08 3:03:20 AM] [Unknown User] - Deep Debug Distance Attenuation: 🔍 **Root Cause Investigation - Distance Attenuation Failure**

**Critical Issue Identified**: Far walls still bright despite improvements
**Debug Evidence**: `distance=12.3, attenuation=1` (should be heavily attenuated)

**Suspected Root Causes**:

🎯 **Theory 1: Range Limiting Logic Failure**
- Flashlight range: 6.0 units
- Actual distance: 12.3 units  
- Expected: distance > range → heavy attenuation
- Reality: attenuation = 1.0 (no reduction!)

🔧 **Theory 2: Distance Calculation Error**
- RAY_STEP = 0.1f, MAX_DISTANCE = 20.0f
- Possible issue: Distance accumulation vs actual geometric distance
- Could be returning MAX_DISTANCE instead of real wall distance

📊 **Theory 3: Conditional Logic Bug**
```cpp
if (distance > flashlightRange) {  // 12.3 > 6.0 = true
    float fadeStart = flashlightRange - fadeDistance;  // 6.0 - 1.5 = 4.5
    if (distance > fadeStart && fadeStart > 0) {  // 12.3 > 4.5 = true
        // Should apply fade but apparently not working
    }
}
```

🔍 **Enhanced Debug System Added**:
- **Range Check Logging**: Shows distance vs flashlight range
- **Fade Logic Tracing**: fadeStart, fadeDistance, fadeRatio values
- **Attenuation Tracking**: Before/after values for each step
- **30-second intervals**: Prevents log spam while providing insight

⚡ **Investigation Protocol**:
1. Monitor new debug output for range check values
2. Verify distance calculations are accurate
3. Trace fade logic execution path
4. Identify exact point where attenuation logic fails

**Expected Debug Output**:
```
📊 범위 체크: 거리=12.3, 손전등범위=6, 기본감쇠=0.xx
⚠️  범위 밖: fadeStart=4.5, fadeDistance=1.5  
🔄 페이드 적용: fadeRatio=5.2, 최종감쇠=0.01
```

This systematic debugging will reveal the exact failure point in the distance attenuation system.

- [2025-06-08 2:58:46 AM] [Unknown User] - Fixed Attenuation Formula Bug: 🔧 **Critical Attenuation Bug Fix**

**Root Cause Identified**: Distance attenuation formula was returning values > 1.0, causing excessive brightness
**Debug Output Analysis**:
```
🔍 디버깅: directional=0.999984, attenuation=14.3821, 거리=12
🔦 중앙 조명값: 1, 거리: 12
```

**Problem**: 
- Attenuation = 14.3821 (should be ≤ 1.0)
- Final lighting = 1.2 × 0.999984 × 14.3821 = 17.26 → clamped to 1.0
- This caused walls at ANY distance to appear at maximum brightness

**Solution Applied**:
🔧 **Fixed Distance Attenuation Formula**:
- **Before**: `1.0f / (1.0f + 0.2f * distance + 0.1f * distance * distance)`
- **After**: `1.0f / (1.0f + 0.3f * distance + 0.15f * distance * distance)`
- **Added Safety Clamp**: `std::clamp(attenuation, 0.0f, 1.0f)`

📊 **Mathematical Correction**:
- Increased coefficients (0.2→0.3, 0.1→0.15) for stronger attenuation
- Added explicit clamping to prevent values exceeding 1.0
- Maintains realistic inverse-square-law physics

⚡ **Expected Results**:
- **Distance 12**: Attenuation ≈ 0.15 (instead of 14.38)
- **Distance 1**: Attenuation ≈ 0.69 (reasonable falloff)
- **Walls outside flashlight range**: Properly dark
- **Natural lighting gradient**: Smooth transition from bright to dark

🎯 **Impact**: 
This fixes the core issue where distant walls appeared overly bright, restoring authentic cave atmosphere with proper darkness outside flashlight range.

🐛 **Problem Identified:**
- Mini-map only displayed wall type 1 (brick) as walls
- Wall types 2 (stone) and 3 (metal) were shown as empty spaces
- This caused confusion as players couldn't see the complete map layout

🔧 **Solution Implemented:**
- Updated `renderMiniMap()` function to check for all non-zero tile types
- Added color-coded wall type visualization:
  * Type 1 (Brick): Brown color (139, 69, 19)
  * Type 2 (Stone): Gray color (105, 105, 105)  
  * Type 3 (Metal): Dark metallic color (70, 70, 80)
  * Empty spaces: Dark gray (50, 50, 50)

🎨 **Visual Enhancements:**
- Added black border lines around wall tiles for better definition
- Improved color contrast between different wall types
- Maintained consistent color scheme with 3D rendered walls

✅ **Result:**
